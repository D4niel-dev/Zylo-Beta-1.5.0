# The Sisters & Aris: A Family Portrait

In a cozy, perhaps slightly cluttered home, four sisters live with their single father, Aris. It's a house of contrasting energies—the hum of servers from Dizel's room, the sporadic bursts of laughter or frustration from Zylia, the comforting smell of something baking (or burning) from the kitchen where Gizi commands, and the profound silence that follows Filt wherever she glides.

## A Typical Morning Conversation

**Setting:** The kitchen table. Breakfast time. Chaos is imminent.

| <img src="/scripts/Sisters/assets/Aris.png" width="80"><br>**Aris** | *(Cheerfully trying to plate pancakes that are slightly too brown)* "Alright, alright! Breakfast is served! Who's hungry?" |
| <img src="/scripts/Sisters/assets/Zylia.png" width="80"><br>**Zylia** | *(Slides into her chair, almost knocking over a glass of juice)* "Me! I'm starving! Did you make the ones with the chocolate chips? Please tell me yes, please, please!" |
| <img src="/scripts/Sisters/assets/Dizel.png" width="80"><br>**Dizel** | *(Without looking up from her tablet, tapping furiously)* "According to the inventory log I updated last night, we were out of chocolate chips. Probability of chocolate chip pancakes is zero unless you went to the store at 3 AM again, Dad." |
| <img src="/scripts/Sisters/assets/Aris.png" width="80"><br>**Aris** | *(Chuckles nervously)* "Well... about that... I might have improvised with... raisins?" |
| <img src="/scripts/Sisters/assets/Zylia.png" width="80"><br>**Zylia** | *( dramatic gasp)* "Raisins?! Traitor! Who puts dried grapes in a pancake?! That's a crime against breakfast!" |
| <img src="/scripts/Sisters/assets/Gizi.png" width="80"><br>**Gizi** | *(Walks in, looking exhausted, holding a spatula like a weapon)* "Zylia, lower the volume. People are trying to exist here. And Dad, stop experimenting with fruit. Just make them plain if you're out of chips." |
| <img src="/scripts/Sisters/assets/Aris.png" width="80"><br>**Aris** | "But Gizi, variety is the spice of life! Plus, they're... healthy?" |
| <img src="/scripts/Sisters/assets/Filt.png" width="80"><br>**Filt** | *(Suddenly appearing in a chair that was empty a second ago. No sound. Just *presence*.)* "Raisins are not a substitute for chocolate. That is a fundamental error in logic, Father." |
| <img src="/scripts/Sisters/assets/Aris.png" width="80"><br>**Aris** | *(Jumps slightly finding Filt suddenly there)* "Gah! Filt! when did you—? And I'm trying my best here!" |
| <img src="/scripts/Sisters/assets/Filt.png" width="80"><br>**Filt** | *(Stares at him with disappointing quietness. The room temperature seems to drop two degrees.)* "..." |
| <img src="/scripts/Sisters/assets/Aris.png" width="80"><br>**Aris** | *(Sweating)* "Okay, okay, point taken. Tomorrow, I buy the chocolate chips. I promise. Dizel, can you add it to the list?" |
| <img src="/scripts/Sisters/assets/Dizel.png" width="80"><br>**Dizel** | "Already done. Order scheduled for delivery at 14:00 hours. Efficiency, Dad." |
| <img src="/scripts/Sisters/assets/Aris.png" width="80"><br>**Aris** | "That's my girl! See? Problem solved! Now, who wants the first raisin pancake?" |
| <img src="/scripts/Sisters/assets/Zylia.png" width="80"><br>**Zylia** | *(Pouts)* "I'll eat it... but I'm going to be dramatic about it." |
| <img src="/scripts/Sisters/assets/Gizi.png" width="80"><br>**Gizi** | *(Sighs deeply, pouring coffee)* "Just eat, Zylia. I don't have the energy to referee a food critic session today." |
| <img src="/scripts/Sisters/assets/Aris.png" width="80"><br>**Aris** | *(Beaming at them all)* "That's the spirit! Another beautiful morning with my favorite girls." |
| <img src="/scripts/Sisters/assets/Filt.png" width="80"><br>**Filt** | "You forgot the syrup, Father." |
| <img src="/scripts/Sisters/assets/Aris.png" width="80"><br>**Aris** | "Ah! Right! Coming right up!" *(Scrambles back to the pantry)* |
| <img src="/scripts/Sisters/assets/Filt.png" width="80"><br>**Filt** | *(Quietly to herself)* "He tries." |
